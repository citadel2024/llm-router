## Background
This project aims to assist in integrating multiple different LLM service providers. However, it does not implement the integration code for each provider; users need to write their own specific implementations. This makes the project focus on management, automatic retries and error handling, load balancing, and rate control, avoiding issues like frequent updates or service provider call failures that occur with projects like `litellm`.


## Features
### Load balancer

### Rate control
